## Background

I had the amazing opportunity to be offered a placement in the Digital Media
Investigations Unit at Lancashire Constabulary. I learnt a lot about the
processes that go into the technical and investigative side of digital
forensics. I visited a few different police stations in the North West and
asked a variety of different questions to learn more about the operations
that take place internally. Hands on with mobile and computer extraction,
processing of computer data, analysing and reporting of computer data, wiping
of hard drives and USB's, completed mobile and computer competency tests,
completed a mock warrant, and attended divisional labs.

## Approach

During the placement, I took charge of a few solo projects to contribute and
improve the internal processes. The main project I was tasked with was to
build an electronic visitor sign-in/out system (Evsios) for officers and
external visitors for the DMIU, which replaced their previous paper system. The
application introduced an intuitive design that matched the force brand and
allowed the DMIU to manage their visitor logs digitally.

I used React Native to build the application and followed a combination of
Kanban and Scrum to lead the project. I kept the product owner informed weekly
with proper documentation regarding the progress of the project throughout its
lifecycle and ensured flexibility for changes and new feature requests.
