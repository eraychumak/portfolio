# The Malthouse Business Centre

2024

The Malthouse Business Centre, a family-run business, is situated in the heart of Ormskirk, Lancashire. Purchased in 1994 by the Lloyd family, this historic 19th-century building – once used for drying grain to make malt – has been lovingly renovated over the past two decades. Today, it offers high-quality office spaces and business units in a unique, characterful setting.

## Motivation

I did this during my time at Edge Hill University where our tutor said pick a local business and create a design for them taking into consideration the user's needs, the business's goals, and the overall user experience. I wanted to create a design that would not only look good but also be functional and user-friendly. The goal was to enhance the online presence of The Malthouse Business Centre, making it easier for potential tenants to find information and get in touch with the business.

## Discovery

I started by researching the business and its target audience. I looked at the existing website and identified areas for improvement.

Some of the key findings included:
- The text contrast was poor, making it difficult to read, especially with the slideshow images.
- There was no clear call to action, making it hard to determine the next steps.
- The logo is bulky and not designed with mobile screens in mind.
- It isn't clear what the offering is as the information was buried in the text.

        </div>
      </td>
    </tr>

## Time to get cooking!

One scope I set is to keep the design simple and clean, focusing on the key information that potential tenants would need. I wanted to ensure that the design was responsive and looked good on both desktop and mobile devices. I also did not want to stray too far from the original design to maintain some brand consistency and resemblance.

### Colours

I used Tailwind's super helpful [Colours](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) documentation to pick out stronger colours that delivered better contrast and readability. I also used the [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure that the colours met accessibility standards.
